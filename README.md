Part1:
First, enter an integer you want to check for in the array. The code will give the location of the integer (if found) as a set of coordinates relating to the 2D array,
and then print the array to show its initial condition.

Part 2:
Now you will be asked to enter a new value. This value will replace the value you entered in Part 1, in the spot it was located. The code will then tell you the swap it made and print the array with the updated value.

Part 3:
Next, you will be asked to enter an integer that will be appended to the array. The code will then tell you what number was added to the array and print the array with the updated value.

Part 4:
Finally, the code will ask you to enter a row and column to identify a value for "deletion". Both rows and columns start at 0. First enter the row number, hit enter, then enter the column number. The code will then tell you the location in which the value was "deleted" and then print the array one final time to show the updated value.
